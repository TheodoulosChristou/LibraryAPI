# LibraryAPI

## Description

LibraryAPI is a .NET Core Web API for managing a library system. It allows users to manage authors, books, and the relationship between them. The API supports CRUD operations and has a structured organization to ensure clean, maintainable code.

## Folder Structure

Below is an overview of the folder structure of the project, along with a description of each folder and its purpose:

### `Controllers/`
This folder contains the API controllers that handle HTTP requests and return responses. Each controller corresponds to a specific entity in the system and is responsible for CRUD operations on that entity.

- `AuthorController.cs` - Manages actions related to `Author` entity, including creation, reading, updating, and deletion of authors.
- `BookController.cs` - Handles actions related to `Book` entity, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books.
- `PublishController.cs` - Manages the relationship between authors and books through the `Publish` entity.
- `UserController.cs` - Manages actions related to `User` entity, including creation, reading, updating and deletion of users.
- `OrderController.cs` -  Manages the relationship between users and books through the `Order` entity. 

### `Models/`
The `Models` folder contains the entity classes that represent the data structure for the API.

- `Author.cs` - Represents the `Author` entity with properties such as `AuthorId` and `Name`.
- `Book.cs` - Represents the `Book` entity with properties such as `BookId` and `Name`.
- `Publish.cs` - Represents the `Publish` entity which links an `Author` to a `Book` through foreign keys.
- `User.cs` - Represents the `User` entity with properties.
- `Order.cs` - Represents the `Order` entity which links a `User` to a `Book` through foreign keys.

### `Data/`
This folder holds the database context and any data access logic.

- `ProjectDbContext.cs` - The main database context class responsible for managing database operations. It inherits from `DbContext` and includes `DbSet` properties for `Author`, `Book`, `Publish`, `Order`, `User`.
  
### `Migrations/`
Contains migration files generated by Entity Framework. These files represent changes in the database schema and are essential for versioning and applying updates to the database structure.

### `DTOs/`
This folder includes Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), which are used to transfer data between the API and the client, abstracting the internal models to ensure data encapsulation and maintain separation of concerns.

### `Repositories/`
This folder contains repository classes that abstract the data access logic, separating concerns between data retrieval/manipulation and business logic.

### `Services/`
The `Services` folder contains service classes that handle business logic. The services communicate with the repositories to perform data operations.

### `Helpers/`
This folder contains utility classes or methods that assist with tasks such as validation, formatting, or other non-business logic.

### `Properties/`
This folder contains the configuration and metadata files used by the project.
